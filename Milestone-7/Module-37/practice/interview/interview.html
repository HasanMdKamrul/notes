    <!-- ** In the 2010 version of the V8 JavaScript engine, there were two main pieces of machinery that did the heavy lifting for the engine. The full-codegen was the baseline compiler whose job was to spit out unoptimized machine code as fast as possible for faster application bootstrap.As the application was running, the crankshaft compiler would kick in and optimize the source code and replace the parts of the machine code generated by the baseline compiler. This optimization would result in better application performance as better and better machine code is generated. -->
    <!-- ** However, this process comes with the cost of large CPU overhead and memory consumption. Hence V8 has to come up with another model. -->
    <!-- ** The above version of the JavaScript engine does not contain an interpreter. This is a JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation model as code is compiled to the machine level on the fly and later optimized, also to the machine code.  -->
    <!-- *** How JavaScript is optimized?
There are various criteria for optimizing JavaScript code. Before JavaScript code is passed to the interpreter or baseline compiler, it has to first get parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which is a tree-like structure of the code.

When we run a JavaScript application, we do not need all the code at the application startup time. For example, if we have a function that is called on the user action, like a button click, that code can be parsed later.

Identifying things that need to be parsed immediately and generating machine code is the best strategy for faster application bootstrap.

Sometimes, JavaScript code contains unnecessary complex logic that can be simplified. For example, a for loop to increment an integer can be inlined using + operations n number of times. This process is called Loop unrolling. Similar optimizations can be made using function inlining

The lack of type system in JavaScript is what makes JavaScript engine produce less optimized machine code. Hence, based on already defined values, a JavaScript engine can guess the data types of the variables and generate better machine code.

This whole process is documented and explained very well by Paul Ryan in his blog post on the V8 engine on alligator.io. You should definitely check read this article to understand these concepts in depth.

Meanwhile, what JavaScript engine can also do is gather profiling data of the code execution and look for the code that runs slower. This code is called the “Hot” code perhaps because it burns the CPU. This code can be further optimized and replaced with an optimized machine code.

Considering these things in mind and other problems caused by full-codegen and crankshaft, the V8 team created a new version of the V8 engine from the ground up. This new version of the JavaScript engine was released in 2017. -->

    <!-- ** As you can see from the above figure, the V8 team introduced a new interpreter pipeline Ignition whose job was to generate the bytecode from the JavaScript source code using a baseline compiler and later interpret that bytecode using an interpreter.The TurboFan optimization compiler can optimize this bytecode in the background (in separate threads) as the application is running and generate a very optimized machine code that will be replaced eventually.Turbofan receives the profiling data from the Ignition interpreter and looks for the code that is Hot. It can make the guesses on how to optimize the code better (by guessing the data types) and optimize or de-optimize the code. -->
