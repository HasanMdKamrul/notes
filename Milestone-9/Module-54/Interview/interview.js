// ** 1. How is React routing different from conventional routing?

// ** In conventinal routing -> every time user hit any url or <a> tag the browser requests a new page from the server but in react router dom when user hit any url or <Link> they requests the page in the client side so that the page renders from the client side not from the server. In React routing, the users feel like they are navigating across distinct(sotontro) webpages while in actuality they arenâ€™t. But, in case of conventional routing, the user actually navigates across different web pages for each individual view.

// ** 6. How many ways we can implement conditinal rendering in React? Explain the ways?

// ? 4 Ways of conditional rendering in react js

// ? 1. If-else with a veriable defined -> we will render data according to the data change in the variable , Example -> true , false data
// ? 2. Ternarry operator -> true ? 'render any component or css class' : 'false hole onno kisu render korbo'
// ? 3. && operator -> something && render an element or component or anything -> ekta logic sotti holei amra dan diker ta render korbo
// ? 4. || operator -> something || render an element or component or anything  -> it means dan diker ta mittha hole or je component ase or element ase oi render hobe
